# 01. Convert Notebooks to *.py and *.md

> This tool allows conversion from an ipynb notebook into .py or .md files.

## Convert all Notebooks in a Folder to Python

One core feature of this library is to convert all notebook files located beneath the `nb_root` folder into python files relative to the `project_root`.
For this conversion the notebook is scanned for:

1. A code cell which contians `#default_exp python_package.for.this.notebook`
2. All code cells where the first line is `#export`

Then using the cells marked with `#export` a python file in `python_package/for/this/notebook.py` is created.
The generated python file should not be modified and the cell and AUTOGENERATED comments must not be deleted.

### *def* **notebook2py**(project_root: str = ".") -> None

Convert all notebooks in the folder.

* **project_root**: The root directory of the project. The default exp path is relative to this folder.
* **nb_root**: The root directory of all the notebooks. Only notebooks in this or any subfolder will be considered.


Example:
```python
notebook2py()
```
Output:
```
Converting to py: jlabdev/convert.ipynb

```

## Convert all Notebooks in a Folder to Markdown

One core feature of this library is to convert all notebook files located beneath the `nb_root` folder into python files relative to the `project_root`.
For this conversion the notebook is scanned for:

1. A code cell which contians `#default_exp python_package.for.this.notebook` is searched to find the output file name.
2. All cells are scanned and based on their type an action is taken:
    * `#hide` -> Cell is ignored.
    * markdown -> The cell is 1 to 1 copied into the doc.
    * `#export` code cell -> The cell is scanned for any public function and class. They are added with their docstring to the markdown.
    * other code cell -> The cell is treated as an example and the code and the output are inserted into the markdown.

### *def* **notebook2doc**(project_root: str = ".") -> None

Convert all notebooks in the folder.

Also converts notebooks annotated with #example in first cell.
All notebooks, which have a title starting with "Example: " are listed under examples without the "Example: " shown in the list.

* **project_root**: The root directory of the project. The default exp path is relative to this folder.
* **nb_root**: The root directory of all the notebooks. Only notebooks in this or any subfolder will be considered.


Example:
```python
notebook2doc()
```
Output:
```
Converting to md: jlabdev/convert.ipynb
Converting to md: setup.py
Converting to md: jlabdev/__init__.py

```

### *def* **python2nb**(project_root: str = ".") -> None

Convert all notebooks in the folder.

* **project_root**: The root directory of the project. The default exp path is relative to this folder.
* **nb_root**: The root directory of all the notebooks. Only notebooks in this or any subfolder will be considered.


---
### *def* **notebook2all**(project_root: str = ".") -> None

Run the notebook2py and notebook2doc commands.

* **project_root**: (Optional[str]) The path to the project root. Default: ".".
